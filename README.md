# Plant Sales Performance Dashboard

This Power BI project presents an interactive dashboard for analyzing the sales and profitability performance of a plant product company. The dashboard provides business-critical insights by comparing current Year-To-Date (YTD) results against the Previous Year-To-Date (PYTD), helping users quickly identify key trends and changes.
